      <description>Last week a tweet by Jacob Andreas triggered a huge discussion on Twitter that many people have called the meaning/semantics mega-thread.
🏎 A crash course on Lexical Meaning &amp;amp; Semantics If you already know what we mean by “Meaning/Semantics” in NLP, you can skip this part and go straight to the debate 🔥.
For the CS/ML folks out there here are a few words of introduction.
First, it’s important to state that Meaning in Natural Language is a multi-facetted concept with semantic, pragmatic, cognitive and social aspects.</description>

      <description>Introduction With the growing availability of digitized text data, there is a great need for effective computational tools to automatically extract kownledge from texts.
The Chinese language differs most significantly from alphabet-based languages in not specifying word boundaries, most existing Chinese text-mining methods require a prespecified vocabulary and/or a large relevant training corpus, which may not be available in some applications.
Pullword is developed for word discovering from small/large volumes of unstructured Chinese texts, and propose ways to order discovered words and conduct higher-level context analyses and it is particularly useful for mining online and domain-specific texts where the underlying vocabulary is unknown or the texts of interest differ significantly from available training corpora.</description>

      <description>Element types in FMR  Constants: Refer to specific objects in the world. A constant can be a number, a lexical string, or an entity. Classes: Semantic category of entities. For example: location.city, math.number  Sub-class: math.number ⊆ math.expression Template classes: classes with one or more parameters, for example: t.list&amp;lt;c, m, n&amp;gt;, where c is a class, m and n are integers.  Functions: The major way to form larger language units from smaller ones.</description>
