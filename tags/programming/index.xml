      <description>Gödel’s incompleteness theorems have been hailed as “the greatest mathematical discoveries of the 20th century” — indeed, the theorems apply not only to mathematics, but all formal systems and have deep implications for science, logic, computer science, philosophy, and so on. In this post, I’ll give a simple but rigorous sketch of Gödel’s First Incompleteness Theorem. Formally, it states that:
 Any consistent formal system $S$ within which a “certain amount of elementary arithmetic” can be carried out is incomplete; i.</description>

      <description>Illustration of the logistic map, $x_{n+1} = f(x_n) = r \cdot x_n \cdot (1 - x_n)$
At $r_1=3$, a stable period $2^1=2$ orbit is born. At $r_2=3.449$ a stable period $2^2=4$ orbit is born. As $r$ continues to increase, the period doublings continue until $r_{\infty} \approx 3.56995$ after which chaotic dynamics begin to occur, interspersed with periodic windows.
The Feigeinbaum constant $\delta=4.6692\dots$ is the ratio of subsequent differences between the values of $r_n$ at which the period doubles, as $n$ approaches infinity.</description>
