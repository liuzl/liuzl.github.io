      <description>In deep learning era, suddenly everything was being represented as these high-dimensional vectors, that quickly became a huge source of data, so it you want to search, rank or give recommendations, the object in your actural database wasn&amp;rsquo;t a document or an image &amp;ndash; it was this mathematical representation of the deep learning model. In short, this quickly became important for a lot of companies.
As a result, vector search engines or vector databases became a core piece of infrasctracture that fuels every big deep learning deployment in industry.</description>
